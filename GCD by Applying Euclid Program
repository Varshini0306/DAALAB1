Algorithm:
step 1: Take two numbers as input.
step2: Find the greater of the two numbers.
step3; Keep on dividing the greater number by the smaller number until remainder becomes 0.
step4: When the remainder becomes 0 print the smaller number i.e., the denominator as the output.
step5: Exit.

Time Complexity: O(log(min(a,b)))
